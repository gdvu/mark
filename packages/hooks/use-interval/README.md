# useInterval

The `useInterval` hook is used to create an interval that executes a function every specified number of milliseconds. It is similar to the `setInterval` function, but it is declarative and can be cancelled.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://www.raddix.website/hooks/use-interval) for more information.
