# useTimeout

The `useTimeout` hook is used to execute a callback after a specified amount of time. It is similar to the `setTimeout` function, but it is declarative and can be cancelled.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://www.raddix.website/docs/interactions/use-timeout) for more information.
